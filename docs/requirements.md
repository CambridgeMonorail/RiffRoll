# Guitar Practice App Requirements Document

## Project Overview

The RiffRoll Guitar Practice App is designed to help guitarists practice effectively by providing a visual, interactive experience. The app will display a scrolling guitar fretboard, synced to a customizable metronome. Users can select a tempo, start/stop the practice session, and see the correct finger positions for playing scales, triads, or arpeggios that match the current chord progression.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Interface

- **Home Screen**:
  - A simple interface to select or create practice sessions with configurable chord progressions and tempo.
- **Practice Screen**:
  - Displays an animated scrolling fretboard in real-time.
  - Shows finger positions for each note, scale, or triad as the chord changes.
  - Visual indicators for upcoming chords and notes.
  - Start, Stop, and Pause buttons for session control.
  - Tempo adjustment control with BPM selector.
  - Volume control for metronome sound.
  - Optional visual metronome (e.g., blinking light or bar animation in sync with beats).

### 2. Fretboard Animation

- **Real-Time Fretboard Animation**:
  - A dynamic fretboard that scrolls horizontally as the chord progression advances.
  - Finger positions for each note shown in real-time, with a focus on:
    - Current chord notes.
    - Appropriate scale or triad notes within the chord.
  - Display note names or tabs for quick identification.
- **Preview of Upcoming Notes**:
  - A visual cue for the next few notes in the sequence, allowing players to anticipate the finger movements.

### 3. Metronome Integration

- **Metronome Sound**:
  - A metronome sound that plays when the practice session starts, synced to the selected BPM.
  - Adjustable sound options for metronome (e.g., choice of click, tap, or custom sound).
  - Visual metronome on screen in sync with the audio.
- **Tempo Selection**:
  - BPM slider to allow users to set the desired tempo (e.g., 40 - 200 BPM).
  - Display showing current BPM setting.
  
### 4. Controls

- **Start Button**:
  - Begins the practice session, starting the fretboard animation and metronome.
- **Stop Button**:
  - Stops both the fretboard animation and metronome.
  - Resets the session to the starting position.
- **Pause Button**:
  - Pauses the fretboard animation and metronome sound.
  - Option to resume from the paused point.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- The app should run smoothly without lagging during animation, even at higher BPMs.
- Ensure low CPU usage for optimal performance on a range of devices.

### 2. Accessibility

- Keyboard shortcuts for controlling Start, Stop, and Pause buttons.
- Customizable font size and contrast settings for text on the fretboard.

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- App should function consistently across web and mobile platforms (consider using a responsive design framework).

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Frameworks and Libraries

- **Frontend**: React (consider using React Native if targeting mobile).
- **Animation Library**: Consider libraries like `GSAP` or `react-spring` for smooth fretboard animations.
- **Metronome Library**: A timing library for precise audio syncing (e.g., `Tone.js` for BPM management).

### 2. Code Architecture

- **Monorepo Setup**: Managed using Nrwl Nx for efficient workspace management and modularity.
- **State Management**: Context API or Zustand for managing user preferences (e.g., BPM, metronome volume, etc.).
  
## Future Enhancements

- **Practice Mode Customization**: Allow users to select specific scales, modes, or arpeggios to practice per chord.
- **Progress Tracking**: Log practice sessions for users to track their improvement over time.
- **Loop Functionality**: Allow users to loop specific sections of the chord progression for targeted practice.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The fretboard should scroll in time with the selected BPM.
- Users should hear a metronome sound in sync with the scrolling fretboard.
- Users can see the finger positions for the notes in real-time.
- The app responds smoothly to Start, Stop, and Pause controls.
