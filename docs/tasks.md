# RiffRoll - Tasks

## 2. Core Components Development
### Practice Screen
- [ ] Implement `PracticeScreen` component with:
  - [ ] `FretboardDisplay` for fretboard animation.
  - [ ] `ControlPanel` for Start, Stop, and Pause functionality.
  - [ ] `MetronomeControls` for tempo slider, volume, and visual metronome.
  - [ ] `Settings Panel` for quick access to sound, tempo, and visuals.
  - [ ] Visual indicators for upcoming chords and notes.

### Fretboard Animation
- [ ] Develop `FretboardDisplay` component for animated fretboard.
- [ ] Implement `NoteMarker` component for finger position indicators.
- [ ] Display note names or tabs for quick identification.
- [ ] Apply smooth scrolling animation using `GSAP` or `react-spring`.
- [ ] Preview upcoming notes with visual cues.
- [ ] Handle edge cases for BPM changes and speed adjustments.

### Metronome
- [ ] Implement `Metronome` component for timing and sound playback using `Tone.js`.
- [ ] Create `MetronomeDisplay` for synchronized visual metronome.
- [ ] Add adjustable BPM slider (40â€“200 range).
- [ ] Include sound options for different metronome sounds.
- [ ] Sync metronome sound with fretboard animation.
- [ ] Provide an option for custom metronome sounds.

### Session Controls
- [ ] Implement `ControlPanel` for session controls (Start, Stop, Pause).
- [ ] Add `TempoControl` slider for adjusting tempo.
- [ ] Set up session state management using Context API or Zustand.
- [ ] Include volume control for metronome.
- [ ] Add status indicators (e.g., play/pause icons).
- [ ] Ensure controls respond smoothly to Start, Stop, and Pause actions.

## 3. State Management
- [ ] Configure global state for session settings (tempo, chord progression, playback status).
- [ ] Add global volume and sound preferences.
- [ ] Define local states for components (e.g., `FretboardDisplay` animation control).
- [ ] Persist user settings (e.g., BPM, volume) between sessions.

## 4. Styling and Responsiveness
- [ ] Integrate Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- [ ] Configure theme with light/dark mode design tokens.
- [ ] Ensure all components are responsive for different screen sizes.
- [ ] Test accessibility features like font size adjustments and contrast settings.

## 5. Event Handling and Interactivity
- [ ] Implement session control buttons (Start, Stop, Pause).
- [ ] Add real-time BPM and volume sliders.
- [ ] Sync fretboard animation and metronome sound dynamically during tempo adjustments.
- [ ] Handle edge cases like smooth resuming after pause and abrupt tempo changes.
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for accessibility (e.g., space for play/pause).
- [ ] Allow users to switch between scales, triads, and arpeggios.

## 6. Additional Utilities and Scripts
- [ ] Add `nx dep-graph` script for dependency graph visualization.
- [ ] Configure affected scripts (`affected:build`, `affected:lint`, `affected:test`) for CI/CD.
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting tools (`nx lint`, `nx format:write`).

## 7. Testing
### Unit Testing
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit testing core components.
- [ ] Write unit tests for fretboard, metronome, and controls.

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Set up Cypress for E2E testing.
- [ ] Define test scenarios for configuring a session, starting/stopping, and adjusting tempo.
- [ ] Test edge cases for tempo adjustments during a session.

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Ensure synchronization between fretboard animation and metronome.
- [ ] Verify responsiveness of session controls across states.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add loop functionality for targeted practice sections.
- [ ] Log and display user progress for practice tracking.
- [ ] Enable custom practice modes (e.g., scale/mode selection).
- [ ] Allow users to save and load custom practice sessions.

## 9. Final Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] Fretboard scrolls in sync with BPM.
  - [ ] Metronome sound aligns with fretboard animation.
  - [ ] Smooth response to Start, Stop, and Pause commands.
  - [ ] Responsive layout on mobile and desktop.
  - [ ] User settings persist between sessions.
  - [ ] Visual indicators for upcoming notes and chords function correctly.
  - [ ] Accessibility requirements are met (keyboard shortcuts, contrast, font sizes).
