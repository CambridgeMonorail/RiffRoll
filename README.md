# RiffRoll

RiffRoll is an interactive guitar practice app that combines an animated fretboard with a customizable metronome to create a dynamic, engaging practice experience. Guitarists can follow along with chord progressions, see finger positions for scales or triads, and control tempo to match their practice needs. Built with React and managed as a monorepo, RiffRoll is designed for scalability and easy collaboration.
